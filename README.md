# Summary
 
This repository, **Computer Vision Crash Course**, provides hands-on activities to explore **computer vision using OpenCV**. Each section covers a fundamental concept, supported by **Colab notebooks, datasets, and documentation**.  

- **Basic I/O Scripting (Images & Videos)** – Covers reading, writing, and processing images and videos in OpenCV.  
- **Edge and Contour Detection** – Explores techniques for detecting object boundaries and contours.  
- **Face Detection using OpenCV** – Implements face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning-based methods.  
- **Line and Circle Detection** – Demonstrates shape detection techniques in images.  
- **Performing Face Recognition** – Tests a trained model to recognize faces, distinguishing between known and unknown individuals.
